DatingDefender 2.2 for Chrome

http://op2600.com

OKCupid scam blocker. Fully self-contained inside of the OKCupid site.
Will help you detect fake profiles and scams on OkCupid. Hope to add more sites and types of scams blocked later.

For now:

1. Alert if "skype", "text", "name" or any email is said to help user avoid divulging data

2. Alert if user profile seems bot like in nature


All alerts are displayed inside the OKCupid site natively so they can't be missed. (They are not alerts or notifications.)
